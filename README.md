# Business-evaluation-of-the-clien

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (Marina_klient.ipynb) that performs an in-depth analysis of client data for Marina. The notebook is designed to load, process, and analyze data related to client interactions, sales, and conversion rates. The analysis is particularly focused on understanding the performance of different OKVED codes (Russian Classification of Economic Activities) over time.

## Introduction
The primary goal of this project is to analyze client data to identify trends, patterns, and key performance indicators (KPIs) related to client interactions and sales. The analysis is performed using Python and popular data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Data Loading
The notebook begins by loading the necessary data files, including client interaction data and organizational data. The data is loaded using Pandas and is stored in DataFrames for further processing.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves several steps:
- Merging client and organizational data.
- Renaming columns for clarity.
- Converting date columns to datetime format.
- Adding new columns for year and month of client interactions.
- Handling missing values and converting data types as needed.

## Data Analysis
The analysis includes:
- Grouping data by INN (Taxpayer Identification Number) and aggregating metrics such as conversation minutes and call counts.
- Calculating conversion rates and profit for each OKVED code.
- Grouping data by year and OKVED code to analyze trends over time.

## Visualization
- The notebook includes several visualizations to help interpret the data:
- Bar charts showing the top 10 OKVED codes by conversion rate for each year.
- Pivot tables summarizing key metrics by year and OKVED code.

## Results
- The analysis provides insights into the performance of different OKVED codes over time. Key findings include:
- The top-performing OKVED codes in terms of conversion rate.
- Trends in conversation minutes, call counts, and profit.
- The impact of different years on client interactions and sales.

## Dependencies
The notebook requires the following Python libraries:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Joblib

## Usage
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open the Marina_klient.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
- Run the notebook cells to load, preprocess, analyze, and visualize the data.
- Modify the notebook as needed to fit your specific data and analysis requirements.
